    <h1>Intel Core Generation</h1> 
    <p><b>Intel Core</b> is a line of mid- to high-end consumer, workstation, and enthusiast central processing units (CPU) marketed by Intel Corporation. 
	These processors displaced the existing mid- to high-end Pentium processors of the time,[when?] moving the Pentium to the entry level, and bumping 
	the Celeron series of processors to the low end. Identical or more capable versions of Core processors are also sold as Xeon processors for the server 
	and workstation markets.</p>
    <p>As of June 2017, the lineup of Core processors includes the Intel Core i9, Intel Core i7, Intel Core i5, and Intel Core i3, along with the X-series 
	Intel Core CPUs.</p>
    <p>In early 2018, news reports indicated that security flaws, referred to as "Meltdown" and "Spectre", were found "in virtually all Intel processors 
	[made in the past two decades] that will require fixes within Windows, macOS and Linux". The flaw also affected cloud servers. At the time, Intel was not 
	commenting on this issue. According to a New York Times report, "There is no easy fix for Spectre ... as for Meltdown, the software patch needed 
	to fix the issue could slow down computers by as much as 30 percent".</p>
    <p>In mid 2018, the majority of Intel Core processors were found to possess a defect (the Foreshadow vulnerability), which undermines the Software Guard 
	Extensions (SGX) feature of the processor.</p>
