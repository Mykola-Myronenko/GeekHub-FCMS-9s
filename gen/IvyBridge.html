    <h1>Intel Ivy Bridge</h1> 
    <p>Ivy Bridge is the codename for the "third generation" of the Intel Core processors (Core i7, i5, i3). Ivy Bridge is a die shrink to 22 nanometer 
	manufacturing process based on the 32 nanometer Sandy Bridge ("second generation" of Intel Core) - see tick–tock model. The name is also applied more 
	broadly to the 22 nm die shrink of the Sandy Bridge microarchitecture based on FinFET ("3D") Tri-Gate transistors, which is also used in the Xeon and 
	Core i7 Ivy Bridge-EX (Ivytown), Ivy Bridge-EP and Ivy Bridge-E microprocessors released in 2013.</p>
    <p>Ivy Bridge processors are backwards compatible with the Sandy Bridge platform, but such systems might require a firmware update (vendor specific).
	In 2011, Intel released the 7-series Panther Point chipsets with integrated USB 3.0 to complement Ivy Bridge.</p>
    <p>Volume production of Ivy Bridge chips began in the third quarter of 2011. Quad-core and dual-core-mobile models launched on April 29, 2012 and 
	May 31, 2012 respectively.[5] Core i3 desktop processors, as well as the first 22 nm Pentium, were announced and available the first week of September 2012.</p>
    <p>Ivy Bridge is the last Intel platform to fully support Windows XP and the earliest Intel microarchitecture to officially support Windows 10 64-bit.</p>
