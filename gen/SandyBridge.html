    <h1>Intel Sandy Bridge</h1> 
    <p>Sandy Bridge is the codename for the microarchitecture used in the "second generation" of the Intel Core processors (Core i7, i5, i3) - the Sandy 
	Bridge microarchitecture is the successor to Nehalem microarchitecture. Intel demonstrated a Sandy Bridge processor in 2009, and released first 
	products based on the architecture in January 2011 under the Core brand.</p>
    <p>Sandy Bridge is manufactured in the 32 nanometer process, while Intel's subsequent generation Ivy Bridge (announced 2011) uses a 22 nanometer die shrink. 
	This was known as the tick–tock model.</p>
    <p>A Core i7 2600 Sandy Bridge CPU at 3.4 GHz with 1333 MHz DDR3 memory reaches 83 GFLOPS performance in the Whetstone benchmark and 118,000 MIPS in the 
	Dhrystone benchmark.</p>
    <p>It is the last Intel microarchitecture for which Windows Vista driver support officially exists.</p>
